## Hello there :wave:! My name is Dimitrios Mpouziotas 

### About me:
Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dimitris Mpouziotas, I have a Bc. degree in Computer Science at the University of Ioannina in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications. I specialize in Computer Vision and Image Processing techniques. I received my degree in the year 2023. My career goal and dream has always been to improve myself to much greater lengths, in order to contribute to evolution and look up to the skies.

 I am a proud developer of the ORACLE model (Optimized Rigorous Advanced Cutting-edge model for Leveraging protection of Ecosystems). ORACLE is capable of detecting and tracking small to medium sized objects. Our objective with ORACLE is to extract valuable analytics from drone footage in remote areas such as the Amvrakikos Gulf in Greece.

### Advices & Inspirations
- Starting from a baseline, mine is to focus on a healthy diet that can support all the aspects I want to improve. <br/>
- Challenge yourself with long-term goals that you don't expect yourself to reach, but also divide these goals into smaller reachable ones, until you are halfway there. That's when you'll feel your high.<br/>
- If you find yourself to be fragile, that is okay. It means that you have lots of room for improvement. The journey might be difficult and challenging. Keep fighting and never say "I give up", you'll love the end results.<br/>
- Be self-aware of your ego and embrace it. It is natural and okay to be egotistic, as long as you are aware of it and don't use it against others. By doing so, you reveal the kindness that resides within your heart. <br/>
